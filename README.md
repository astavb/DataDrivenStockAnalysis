Data Driven Stock Analysis (Beginner Project)

This is a beginner-friendly stock market analysis project.  
I worked with real NIFTY50 stock data to understand market performance, calculate returns, and visualize insights using Python and Power BI.


 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter / VS Code
- Streamlit (Simple interactive dashboard)
- Power BI (Visual dashboard)
- CSV data (Converted from raw YAML files)

What I Did Step-by-Step
1. Converted raw stock data from YAML to CSV format.
2. Cleaned the data and removed missing/invalid rows.
3. Calculated **Daily Return** and **Yearly Return** for each stock.
4. Identified **Top Gainers** and **Top Losers**.
5. Visualized results using:
   - Python charts (Volatility, Cumulative return, Correlation heatmap)
   - Power BI dashboard
6. Created a simple Streamlit page to interactively view stock trends.

 Key Insights
- TRENT was the top performing stock based on yearly return.
- INDUSINDBK was one of the lowest performing.
- Majority of stocks in the dataset had a positive yearly return.
- Market trend was overall upward, supported by chart visuals.

What I Learned
- How to clean and structure financial market data
- How returns are calculated and interpreted
- How to create dashboards to communicate results visually
- How small insights tell meaningful market stories

This is a beginner project, focused on learning — not complexity.
